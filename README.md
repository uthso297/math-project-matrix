# Minor and Cofactor Calculator

This C program calculates the minor and cofactor of a given element in a square matrix. It allows users to input a matrix, select an element, and compute its minor and cofactor using determinant calculations.

## Features
- User inputs a matrix of size up to 10x10.
- Calculates the minor of a selected element.
- Computes the cofactor of the element based on its position.
- Uses recursion to determine the determinant of the minor matrix.

## How It Works
1. The user specifies the matrix size.
2. The user enters the matrix elements.
3. The program prints the entered matrix.
4. The user selects a row and column.
5. The program calculates and prints:
   - The minor of the selected element.
   - The cofactor of the selected element.

## Technologies Used
- **C Programming**: Core logic and calculations.
- **Standard Input/Output (stdio.h)**: User input handling and output display.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, use the following commands:
-**Step-1**: Clone the repository
-**Step-2**: Open with VsCode or other IDEs
-**Step-3**: Then run the code

## Example Usage
```
Enter the size of matrix A:
3 3
Enter element [1][1]= 1
Enter element [1][2]= 2
Enter element [1][3]= 3
...
Enter row number and column number: 2 2
Minor of matrix A is:
...
The cofactor of the element in position [2][2] is: -4.000000
```
